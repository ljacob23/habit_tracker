# Habit Tracker
This web application will be used to help me create a tracker for all my goals in 2024. The most challenging goal I've set for myself is to complete 75 hard. It is this 75 day physical and mental challenge with all these rules you have to follow. 
* no alcohol
* 2 45 minute workouts every day (one has to be inside, one has to be outside)
* drink a gallon of water a day
* follow a diet plan of your choice
* Read 10 pages of a nonfiction book every day
* Take a progress picture every day (for personal reasons I don't think I will be doing this)

Currently, I struggle to drink 1/4 a gallon of water a day, I run three times a week, hand ave an unhealthy relationship with food. I'm not doing 75 hard because I think these are healthy habits I want for the rest of my life, but I think it will help me BUILD similar habits.
