# Habit Tracker
This web application will be used to help me create a tracker for all my goals in 2024. The most challenging goal I've set for myself is to complete 75 hard. It is this 75 day physical and mental challenge with all these rules you have to follow. 
* no alcohol
* two 45 minute workouts every day (one has to be inside, one has to be outside)
* drink a gallon of water a day
* follow a diet plan of your choice
* Read 10 pages of a nonfiction book every day
* Take a progress picture every day (for personal reasons I don't think I will be doing this)
* Solve at least one leetcode question every day (this is a personal one I'm adding)

Currently, I struggle to drink 1/4 a gallon of water a day, I run three times a week, hand ave an unhealthy relationship with food. I'm not doing 75 hard because I think these are healthy habits I want for the rest of my life, but I think it will help me BUILD similar habits.

## Goals
As I mentioned before I don't have the healthies relationship with food, which outside of my 75 hard challenge, is something I want to work on in 2024. Sometimes I lose my appetite for days at a time, and I know it's related to how I view myself. If I struggle with something at work or am faced with another rejection, I spiral and feel like I'm not good enough at anything. So I try to fix the things I can control, like what I eat. However, as I said this is something I want to fix.  
  
I also have a 10 mile race April 20th (I have never ran more than 4 miles in my life before). I have quickly noticed that my eating habits greatly affect my training for this race. I signed up for this race with my best friend, and I want us to do this together. So for myself and for her, I have to do better.
  
I also want to get a job being a software engineer instead of my current role as an SRE. I can't control the job market or other people's applications, but I can control my outlook and the things I do to fix it. So it is currently January 10th, and I am planning on starting 75 hard on January 29th. Which means I want my first ever full stack web application created soley by myself to be done in 19 days. So this is a technical goal I'll be completing in order to help me achieve my physical goals.
